## Purpose

Visual Studio extension which shows file paths in tab titles with same file names.

This extension is currently very basic and just prepends parent directory name to duplicate tab titles. The end goal is to make it work like similar feature of Visual Studio Code.

Improvement suggestions are welcome.

## Compatibility

The extension currently works with Visual Studio 2017. Support for other versions might be added in future.

The extension is compatible with the [Custom Document Well](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.CustomDocumentWell) extension (a component of [Productivity Power Tools 2017](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.ProductivityPowerPack2017)).
