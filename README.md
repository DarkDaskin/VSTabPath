## Purpose

Visual Studio extension which shows file paths in tab titles with same file names.

It is inspired by a built-in feature of Visual Studio Code and has similar look and feel, showing relevant path segments next to file names.

Improvement suggestions are welcome.

## Compatibility

The extension currently works with Visual Studio 2017 - 2019. Support for other versions might be added in future.

The extension is compatible with the [Custom Document Well](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.CustomDocumentWell) extension (a component of [Productivity Power Tools 2017](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.ProductivityPowerPack2017)).
